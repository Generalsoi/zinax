            Detractors of DeFi, NFTs, Social tokens all have one stone, lack of
            real life utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most DeFi tokens donâ€™t resonate with our everyday life, and the
            projects usually have no real life utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zinax brings utility to DeFi. We bring startups building real life
            companies, NFTs with tangible use cases, Social tokens from everyday
            names and play-to-earn games that are based on real life situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="second-span">
              Zinax is the revolution of the blockchain, from hype to real life.
